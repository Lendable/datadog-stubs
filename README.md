# Lendable's stubs for the DataDog PHP tracer
The DataDog APM tracing extension is moving towards exposing most functionality to user-land from C. 
Stubs aren't provided, so IDE and static analysis tooling tends to not pick up the existence of these APIs.

This small package aims to fill this gap.

Note: This currently only fills Lendable's requirements, and does not act as a full stub solution - contributions welcome.
